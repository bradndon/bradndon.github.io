# Introduction
In the world of development, having your software be portable is a critical
idea. You want everyone in the world to be able to use your software, not just
users running Windows or users running Linux. For a long time I had heard the
term virtual machine (or VM), but I never understood the point of them entirely.
This post will look at the usefulness of virtual machines and a beginning look
at installing and creating VM's using Oracle's VM VirtualBox.

# What are virtual machines?
In essence, a virtual machine is a computer inside your computer. A virtual
machine can emulate a different operating system than the one your computer
is currently running. In addition to emulating the software of the operating
system chosen, it can emulate hardware as well. In the portability example
above, a virtual machine would be extremely useful so that you can test your
code on many different environments.
