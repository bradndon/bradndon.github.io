#Introduction
Last week, I talked about the importance and usefulness of virtual machines.
They are helpful in many situations. You may be thinking however "Brandon, you
said we would be talking about collaborative tools, but virtual machines seem
like they would only be useful personally." Do not worry, that is what this post
is all about! We are going to look at a tool that can be used to easily have the
same virtual machine running on everyone in your groups machines and that tool
is [Vagrant][vagrant]. From their website, Vagrant is a tool that is used to
"Create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development
environments." While I feel like every tool that is out there claims to be
"lightweight" and "easy", Vagrant actually feels that way. Let's get started
with the basics.

#Installing
Installing Vagrant is as simple as it gets, head over [here][download], and
download it for your operating system. (Note: You may also need to download
[VirtualBox VM][virtualbox].) Once it finishes, go ahead and open up a
console instance and head to an empty directory. Then type the commands:
{% highlight bash %}
vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64
vagrant up
{% endhighlight %}
That is all it takes, and once it installs the operating system, we have the same
outcome as the end of my last post. Based alone on how it takes two lines to get
a complete virtual machine up and running is amazing. In addition, if you want
to take a look at all the different machines you can create, check [here][boxes].

#What's Next?
Now we have a virtual machine running, how can we access it? Before, we could
easily use the machine since it had a GUI. Vagrant on the other runs from the
command prompt. In order to access it, simply type:
{% highlight bash %}
vagrant ssh
{% endhighlight %}
Now we are on a command prompt in our virtual machine! At this point you are
probably wondering what gain this has over a normal VM. In order to see this
head over to the `/vagrant` folder and list the contents of it
{% highlight bash %}
vagrant ssh
ls
{% endhighlight %}
What you will see, is a file named Vagrantfile. In the directory you ran
`vagrant init`, you will also see a file named Vagrantfile. What Vagrant does
when you create a machine, is it mirrors the directory you make the VM in. This
makes it so that as you edit files on your machine, they are automatically
updated on the virtual machine.
