Introduction
------------
For my final post in this series, I thought we could take a step away from the
code and talk about some tools that can help manage a project (especially ones
with a team involved) as well as communicate effectively. The applications I
will discuss are definitely not the only options, they are just the ones I am
familiar with. The tools we will be looking at today are [Trello][trello] and
[Slack][slack].

Trello
------
At it's core, Trello is a way to organize your life. This tool could be useful
for getting organized for yourself, or for you and your roommates, but today we
will look at it in the context of being a project management tool. Trello works
with these screens called "boards". You can think of them like a bulletin board.
On these boards, you add lists that have titles such as "Features to Add" and
then to these lists you can add cards for each feature you want to add in this
case. The cards can hold a lot of information as you can add comments, documents,
pictures, a checklist, and even a due date. Another list you may have is one
named "Working on", which you would move things to when you are working on them.
This way your team will know that you are working on something and what it is.
Finally you could have a "Finished" list that contains all the finished features.
In addition to this, each card can have tags associated with it so that you can
know information about that card without having to read the description. Here is
an example of Trello in action:

As you can see we have an expanded number of lists than the three suggested
above, but they follow the same pattern: things to add, things being worked on,
and things that are finished. You can also see the advantages of using the tags
because just from looking at the card "Move / Retrofit the Lost and Found App
that's currently inside the VU site." I know that it is a high priority task, is
for the development team (since we have developers and designers), and is for the
VU site. All this information I can gather without needing to read anymore than
the title and look at some colors. This tool is extremely helpful and useful to
any team that needs to stay organized.

Slack
-----
Slack is an application that has been gaining a lot of traction lately. It is
marketed as "A messaging app for teams" and accomplishes what a basic messaging
app can do as well as much more. With Slack you create different "channels" for
different topics. These channels can be public, where anyone on your team can
join or private, where the members must be invited. One situation I have seen
the usefulness of this is in companies that do work for a lot of different
individuals, the team invites that person to a slack channel about their project
so that they can ask questions in a less official way than email. In addition
to messaging, Slack can integrate with a lot of different services. For example,
there is a channel on my Slack for work that just keeps updates on our source
control repositories. This lets us know when anybody is adding new code to our
code base as well as who is doing it. There are also integrations to keep track
of your analytics, be alerted of events coming up, your Trello boards
and even one to easily send random gifs to your team. Slack is becoming more and
more of a mainstay application in workplaces so it can never hurt to start
getting used to it now.

Conclusion
----------
Trello and Slack are fantastic tools to help your team stay organized. Even for
personal projects, keeping yourself on track with Trello can be very helpful. It
really helps you see the end of the tunnel for your project. Slack can be a
useful messaging tool for teams of any size that struggle to stay in touch and
manage many different services.
