# Introduction
In the world of development, having your software be portable is a critical
idea. You want everyone in the world to be able to use your software, not just
users running Windows or users running Linux. For a long time I had heard the
term virtual machine (or VM), but I never understood the point of them entirely.
This post will look at the usefulness of virtual machines and a beginning look
at installing and creating VM's using [Oracle's VM VirtualBox][virtualbox].

# What are virtual machines?
In essence, a virtual machine is a computer inside your computer. A virtual
machine can emulate a different operating system than the one your computer
is currently running. In addition to emulating the software of the operating
system chosen, it can emulate hardware as well.

# Why virtual machines?
You may be thinking that virtual machines sound cool, but you do not necessarily
see how they could be useful on an everyday basis. One use for example, is that
in the portability example above, a virtual machine would be extremely useful
so that you can test your code on many different environments. This is much
easier than needing to have many different computers with different operating
systems or even one computer that can dual boot between them.

Another common use for a virtual machine is to enable practice setting up a
server without having to pay for one. Because a server you would rent from
someone like [Digital Ocean][digitalocean] or [AWS][aws] would be a base
operating system that you must set up yourself securely. A virtual machine is a
free way to practice this process so that when you are paying for a server, you
will not need to waste any time learning how to set it up.

One final use that we will talk more in depth next week about is being able for
you to collaborate with a group and all be developing in an environment that
works for all the members. It makes it significantly easy to collaborate across
operating systems when you can all develop in the same environment.

# A VirtualBox Initiation
We are now going to play around with creating a virtual machine and show off
some of the capabilities that they have. To start, head over to the
[VirtualBox website][virtualbox] and follow the steps to install VirtualBox on
your operating system. Once you get it up and running, go ahead and type `ctrl+N`
to create a new virtual machine. This will bring up this screen:

As you can see, I decided to name mine `My Shiny New Virtual Machine` and I
decided to make it run Ubuntu since I am already running Windows. On the next few
pages, just use the recommended settings for now, you can play around with the
amount of memory and hard drive size another time. Once you have gone through
those steps, you will see your new virtual machine in the list of machines like so:

You can now double click the machine and it will boot it up for you. You will
see that it cannot boot up. The problem is that we do not have the image of the
computer preinstalled on our machine. To fix this, head over [here][ubuntu] and
download the desktop image you would like to use. Then click the Settings button
and under storage click the button that looks like a CD and select the .iso file
you just downloaded. Now when you boot it up it will boot up Ubuntu as intended.

Now you can use this virtual machine just like a Linux machine. Depending on the
virtual machine you create, your cursor may be captured by the machine. This
means that the VM will have control and you will not be able to use your mouse
on your normal operating system anymore. In order to fix this, you just have to
press the button that appears in the bottom right of the virtual machine, in my
case it was `Right Ctrl`. Now you can create more virtual machines and play
around with different operating systems. It can help testing code that needs to
be portable significantly easier.
